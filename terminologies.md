# Terminologies

- HTTP Request:
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the langauage used for internet communication.
  - We send the `http` request to the target server. To send the copy of the web page to the client using TCP/IP.
  - HTTPS requests, is the secured version of `http`, this ensures a secured authentication between the client and server are encrypted.

- TCP/IP:
  - IP are the rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another. over an internet connection.
  - TCP works with IP to ensure the transfer of data is dependable and reliable, it creates session or connection to ensure that no packets are lost, and are organized in proper sequence.

- Packet:
  - When the web server is asked to send a copy of the web page or email or what ever its asked to send, using TCP/IP. It doesn't actually send that page all at once, it breaks that data down into what we call `packets`. Thos packets of data which are kind of like chunck of data, that are splited into segments. And basically TCP/IP is responsible for ensusring that those packets all reliably get to the client in the proper order.

- Port:
  - If an IP address is like the postal address, the port number that is listning is kind of like the mailbox number. The port number for HTTP protocol is `80`, while the port number for HTTPS protocol is `443`.
