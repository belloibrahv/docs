# Networking

- What is a Network?
- Why do we need Networks?

We need networks to share resources. A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in other to share resources such as printers, CDs, exchange files or allow electronic communication.

- The computers on a network maybe linked through cables, telephone lines, radiowave, satallites, or infrared light beams.

To understand this better lets start at the very beginning:

- In the late 1960s, some very smart people had computers and decided that would it not more make sense that my computer can talk to your computer, because before network existed, to share any file you will have to put the files in a floppy disc and physically walk to the other person that you want to share the file with. While this approach is inefficient.
- Then they created the infrastructure for the communication to be possible, but back then each company had there own infrastructure, protocol and processes for there servers to communicate with one another.
- So at some point they came together to decide ways to make it compatible, so that they can all communicate together. That was when network protocols were invented, and there were two main protocol which were find to be the main standard such as TCP/IP and OSI.
- We want to establish why do we want to have computer network, and that is because we want to share resources which could be a printer, file, a video etc., back then if you want to use a printer, each printer would need to have is own computer, that is one computer for each printer because there was no other way to share a printer. After we had networks, one printer could be shared by 10 computers or more, which makes sharing of resources much better.
- Even with the video you tend to watch or download from the internet, which could be considered as been shared or watched from a computer network which is shared via a data link, which can be a physical cable (like twisted pair, fibre optics etc.) or some kind of data link where information is shared through (Wifi for example). In other to share a resource to your recipient, what you'll need for this data exchange is (1) a device (2) transimission media via physical cable, or wireless. So rather than having to physically transferring a file on a USB drive, like the floppy disc of the old days, we now have a much better mechanism to transmit data from one device to another or from one device to many devices.
